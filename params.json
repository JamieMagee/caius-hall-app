This is purely to help me in knowing roughly how many people are using it and what versions of android they are using etc.**\r\n\r\nFeel free to download the source and propose any changes/additions to the application. Additionally, if you're worried that I will somehow steal your passwords, you can check the source code or get a friend to do so. If you are still worried, please don't use the application.\r\n\r\nThe latest compiled APK debug version of the application can always be found [here](http://jdb75.user.srcf.net/apks/CaiusHall-debug-latest.apk). Please submit any bug reports to the issues page on github or email me at jdb75@cam.ac.uk.","name":"CaiusHall Android App","tagline":"Android app for booking dinner in Caius.","google":"UA-34627503-1"}
